# odin-recipes
I'm not really sure what we're going to be creating at the moment.
Still going through the instructions, but will update when project is finished with:

    1. What I learned
    2. Future plans for project
    3. Confidence level in HTML

This is a fun first project. I didn't go through and add two other recipes, YET, but maybe I will as I progress through CSS and JS portions of the course. I haven't touched HTML since somewhere around 5th grade, nearly 17 years ago!!! It was cool to go through a more "formal" process to learn this instead of just finding unorganized jumbles of code on the internet trying to figure out how to make anything work. It feels like HTML came back pretty naturally, but I know there's still much more advanced stuff out there.

I think the biggest and most helpful things I've learned so far have been Linux/Ubuntu and Git commands through the CLI. I've only ever used Windows/Mac up until starting The Odin Project so I feel like a kid again learning all of this "new" technology.

Can't wait to learn more!
