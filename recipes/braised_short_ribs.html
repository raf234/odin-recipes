        <h3>
            <u>Steps</u>
        </h3>
        <h4>Gremolata Topping</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 parts parsley</li>
            <li>1 part minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 part lemon zest</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Parmigiana Polenta</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>400g water</li>
            <li>5g Salt</li>
            <li>100g Polenta (yellow corn grits)</li>
            <li>30g nonfat milk</li>
            <li>30g Parmigiana Reggiano</li>
            <li>20g Butter</li>
            <li>10 cranks Black pepper</li>
            <li>Pinch of gremolata (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Braising Prep (day before):</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heavily salt the exterior of the short ribs. (optional) Let dry brine for at least 3 hours or overnight in the fridge.</li>
            <li>On the day of braising, preheat the oven to 275 F. Prep the mirepoix by dicing the white onion, carrot, and celery. It should roughly be 2 parts onion, 1 part carrot, 1 part celery.</li>
            <li>Set a dutch oven or braising pot over medium-high heat and add the oil. Once hot place the short ribs down and sear on all sides. Take your time to develop a nice crust on all sides. Once browned, set the ribs aside and turn the heat down to medium.</li>
            <li>Add the diced onion, carrot, and celery along with a big pinch of salt and cook while stirring for about 10 to 15 minutes until the onion is nicely browned.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato paste and cook just for about a minute until it turns a deep red. Pour in the wine and scrape the bottom of the pan to release any fond that has developed. Let cook for 2 minutes to slightly reduce the wine.</li>
            <li>Return the browned ribs to the pot and add enough stock or water to the pot so it comes 3/4 of the way up the ribs. Bring the liquid to a simmer then partially cover the lid and slide in the preheated 275 F oven.</li>
            <li>Let the ribs braise for roughly 4 hours which will allow enough time for the collagen to turn into gelatin making them fork tender. Once fork-tender, pull the pot out of the oven and let cool until the liquid reaches 140 F and the ribs are cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>If desired, you can remove the bone and clean up the ribs before storing it. Move the ribs to an airtight container and store in the fridge. Strain the cooking liquid into a container and set it in the fridge overnight so the fat congeals to the top.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Cooking (day of):</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the fat from the cooled cooking liquid. Set a pan over medium-low heat and add the liquid to the pan, bring to a simmer and let slowly reduce while stirring for about 20 minutes. Be careful not to burn!</li>
            <li>Prepare the polenta by bringing the milk, water, and a big pinch of salt to a boil. While whisking, add the polenta and cooking for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and cover for 10 minutes until thickened to your liking.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the gremolata by mincing 2 parts parsley, 1 part garlic, and 1 part lemon zest.</li>
            <li>When the cooking liquid has reduced so it leaves a trail with a spatula, add in the short ribs and coat the exterior to bring them up to temperature. Turn the heat off and set a lid on top.</li>
            <li>Once the polenta is done, remove from the heat and stir in the butter, the parmesan, a few cranks of black pepper, and a pinch of the gremolata if you would like.</li>
            <li>To serve, spread the polenta onto a plate, add a spoonful or two of the reduced sauce, top with a short rib, and more sauce over the top. Garnish with the gremolata. Devour.</li>
        </ol>
